abstract ={The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

abstract="Data stream mining is among the most vital contemporary data science challenges. In this work we concentrate on the issue of actual availability of true class labels. Assumption that the ground truth for each instance becomes known right after processing it is far from being realistic, due to usually high costs connected with its acquisition. Active learning is an attractive solution to this problem, as it selects most valuable instances for labeling. In this paper, we propose to augment the active learning module with self-labeling approach. This allows classifier to automatically label instances for which it displays the highest certainty and use them for further training. Although in this preliminary work we use a static threshold for self-labeling, the obtained results are encouraging. Our experimental study shows that this approach complements the active learning strategy and allows to improve data stream classification, especially in scenarios with very small labeling budget.",

abstract="Conventional stream mining algorithms focus on stand-alone mining tasks. Given the single-pass nature of data streams, it makes sense to maximize throughput by performing multiple complementary mining tasks concurrently. We investigate the potential of concurrent semi-supervised learning on data streams and propose an incremental algorithm called CSL-Stream (Concurrent Semi--supervised Learning of Data Streams) that performs clustering and classification at the same time. Experiments using common synthetic and real datasets show that CSL-Stream outperforms prominent clustering and classification algorithms (D-Stream and SmSCluster) in terms of accuracy, speed and scalability. Moreover, enhanced with a novel active learning technique, CSL-Stream only requires a small number of queries to work well with very sparsely labeled datasets. The success of CSL-Stream paves the way for a new research direction in understanding latent commonalities among various data mining tasks in order to exploit the power of concurrent stream mining.",

abstract="The article presents a new algorithm for handling concept drift: the Trigger-based Ensemble (TBE) is designed to handle concept drift in surgery prediction but it is shown to perform well for other classification problems as well. At the primary care, queries about the need for surgical treatment are referred to a surgeon specialist. At the secondary care, referrals are reviewed by a team of specialists. The possible outcomes of this review are that the referral: (i) is canceled, (ii) needs to be complemented, or (iii) is predicted to lead to surgery. In the third case, the referred patient is scheduled for an appointment with a surgeon specialist. This article focuses on the binary prediction of case three (surgery prediction). The guidelines for the referral and the review of the referral are changed due to, e.g., scientific developments and clinical practices. Existing decision support is based on the expert systems approach, which usually requires manual updates when changes in clinical practice occur. In order to automatically revise decision rules, the occurrence of concept drift (CD) must be detected and handled. The existing CD handling techniques are often specialized; it is challenging to develop a more generic technique that performs well regardless of CD type. Experiments are conducted to measure the impact of CD on prediction performance and to reduce CD impact. The experiments evaluate and compare TBE to three existing CD handling methods (AWE, Active Classifier, and Learn++) on one real-world dataset and one artificial dataset. TBA significantly outperforms the other algorithms on both datasets but is less accurate on noisy synthetic variations of the real-world dataset.",

In this paper, we investigate the effects of estimate errors affecting the a posteriori probabilities on the optimality of Chow's rule. We show that the optimal error-reject tradeoff is not provided by Chow's rule if the a posteriori probabilities are affected by errors. The use of multiple reject thresholds related to the data classes is then proposed. The authors have proved in another work that the reject rule based on such thresholds provides a better error-reject trade-off than in Chow's rule. Reported results on the classification of multisensor remote-sensing images point out the advantages of the proposed reject rule.",

abstract="Valiant (1984) and others have studied the problem of learning various classes of Boolean functions from examples. Here we discuss incremental learning of these functions. We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space.",
